## Description
In this challenge you'll be cloning this repo (don't fork), and loading this app locally and then:
1. Debug where necessary
2. Become familiar with the current behavior of the app (What is being generated?  What is being transformed?).
3. Optimize performance as best you can
4. Refactor and restructure app
5. Write tests (Hint: Use this step to ensure you don't change the apps behavior)
6. Feature Add - Calculate and display runtime
7. **BONUS** - Style the app

Please make sure your latest commit contains only your changes.

See below for loading instructions.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
